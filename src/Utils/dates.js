Do you know that after you came back I got belief in God. The day before you came back to me i.e. Vaikunta Ekadasi 13-01-2022, I have requested God, ' Oh God!!

Much like the ocean's tides, we may drift apart but eventually gravitate back towards each other. In a world where life hinges on the existence of trees, my life finds its anchor in you. As the sky is adorned with clouds and stars, let's adorn our journey with the dream of nurturing two precious children‚Äîa boy as luminous as the stars and a girl as pure as clouds.

      'Distance makes you realise the value of true love. When the person you love is with you, you will be happy, feel safe, and everything seems to be very good. But when the person is away from you, you will get to know how much you value them, and love them.',

    letter:
      "Undoubtedly, our memories, whether sweet or bitter, were crafted by both of us, and regardless of their flavor, they're destined to journey with us. Sweet memories hold the true essence of our shared life, akin to how flowers release their fragrances, while bitter memories can be transformed into our most valuable life lessons.Just as the sun and moon, distant in the sky, still manage to radiate their warmth and coolness, I will forever feel the embrace of your warmth and the soothing touch of your presence, no matter the physical distance. Much like only the lotus petals grace the surface of a pond, concealing the depth of its submerged stem, our love might be observed and judged superficially by others, but they remain unaware of its true profundity. People often claim that there's no end to hunger, but our love is beyond such limitations. Yes, my love does come with a single condition: your companionship by my side for the entirety of my life. Even if that means staying as friends, it's something I am more than content with. Please bare my immaturity forever papa. Love a lot papa and Happy Anniversary‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è!!!",
